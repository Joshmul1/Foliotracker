# Folio-tracker

## Whats Uploaded:
* Started GUI code with some things that I worked out for later
* Created a newFolio() method which is hopefully future proof in terms of adding
a new generic folio to tabbedPane

## Listeners
* closeListener - closes the program from menu at top via exit button




## API:
### Folio:
    * addStock
    * removeStock
    * getStock
    * getName
    * setName
    * getValue
    
### Stock:
    * getName
    * setName
    * getShares
    * setShares
    * getPricePerShare
    * setPricePerShare
    Not sure about below. It is in screenshot?
    * getTickerSymbol
    * setTickerSymbol
